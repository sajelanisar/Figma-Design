							</p>
							<p>
								But, thinking about incapacity, disability or
								death isn't very fun. You know you should do
								something to prepare, and you've heard words like
								powers of attorney, wills, trusts, long-term care,
								Medicaid and probate,but you're not sure what they
								mean for you. Plus, you've heard bad things abou working
								with lawyers: they're expensive, they use confusing legal
								terms instead of plain english, they try to sell you expensive
								documents you don't really need, they bill you for every little
								phone all or email, and once the works is finished you never
								formt them again.
